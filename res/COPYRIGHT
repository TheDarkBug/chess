I'm still choosing a license for the textures that I am creating for this game, so right now
** NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO USE THEM IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM UNTIL I DECIDE ON A LICENSE. **
This is valid for all the files in the res folder of the [chess](https://github.com/TheDarkBug/chess) repository.
Feel free to recommend a license.
